# Running #

To have the whole Cloudsim app running, we need to launch 3 servers:

* Authentication server: [cloudsim-auth](Running_auth)
* Portal: [cloudsim-portal](Running_portal)
* Widgets: [cloudsim-widgets](Running_widgets)

If you're planning on using the live auth and portal servers, skip to
`Cloudsim-widgets`.
