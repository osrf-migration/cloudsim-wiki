## Running locally ##

After you've installed and configured your environment...

Then, you can start each server locally, with a `gulp serve` or perhaps `npm start`. Naturally, each server running on a single machine needs a unique port number, otherwise it won't start.

Cloudsim-widgets needs to know the url for each service (auth, portal, sim...), and that's usually set in it'd .env file.
